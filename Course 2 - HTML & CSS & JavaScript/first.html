<!-- Description
 You have to link two web pages together. Assume you’re on the first page named ‘first.html’ and you want to move to the next one, that is, ‘second.html’, when you click on some text on the first page, which says ‘Take me to the second page’. The address of the second page is “https://www.second.com/”. How will you achieve this? Write a code for the same. -->
