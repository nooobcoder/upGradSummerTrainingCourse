		<h1>The Tech Chronicle</h1>
		<p id="paraText">
			As the world continues to embrace technological advancements at a
			pace that’s growing exponentially, the demand for software
			developers is on the rise. It is software developers who collaborate
			with data scientists and analysts to build software and applications
			that are transforming the entire canvas of the global society on a
			massive scale. Today we have an app for addressing all our needs –
			Uber, Airbnb, Zomato, PayPal, Amazon, and so much more. Then again,
			we now have smart personal assistants like Siri, Alexa, Cortana, and
			Google Assistant that can perform a range of impressive tasks for
			us, from controlling our IoT devices to doing shopping for us!
